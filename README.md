### Hey I'm Will Burrows ðŸ‘‹

I work as a Quality Assurance Tester at a Magento Dev Agency out of Michigan.
That being said I'm looking to put my CS degree to good use and develop a strong foundation in FE/BE development.
Most of my work thus far has been college related with a few side projects here and there but none of that is going to be included on this account. This is a space for passion projects and collaboration with the community.
